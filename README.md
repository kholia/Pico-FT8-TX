# Appreciation

First of all, many thanks to Roman for this brilliant WSPR project! The world
has never seen a WSPR beacon on such an inexpensive and small hardware ;-).

Simply ingenious is the controller-controlled oscillator, which can be
modulated to milliherzts - the heart of the beacon and the project!

As Roman writes in his project description: "It doesn't require any hardware -
Pico board itself only."

Dhiru: This branch adds FT8 + "rig control" support.

# Hardware Setup

The antenna connects to Pin 9 (`GP6`) on the Pico board.

# Bringing Pico beacon on air

Step 1: Compile the project and copy the `build/pico-wspr-tx.uf2` file to the
Pico board.

```
mkdir -p ~/repos

cd ~/repos

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

export PICO_SDK_PATH=$HOME/repos/pico-sdk

./build.sh
```

Step 2: Power the Pico board

Step 3: Run WSJT-X and the included `transceiver_server.py` helper script.

Step 4: Use the WSJT-X software to transmit a message as usual.

# Amplifier?

Please note that the signal generated by the Pico is not a very clean one. A
BPF must be placed between the Pico's output and the amplifier.

https://github.com/kholia/HF-PA-v10/tree/master/IRFP-Hacks-v5-SMD is a pretty
decent amplifier design for 5W to 20W.

You can also try the `2W Amplifier 1-930MHz module` that is available on
Amazon, and other places.

# TR Switch

Use the well tested https://github.com/kholia/Simple-TR-Switch project.
