# Appreciation

First of all, many thanks to Roman for this brilliant WSPR project! The world
has never seen a WSPR beacon on such an inexpensive and small hardware ;-).

Simply ingenious is the controller-controlled oscillator, which can be
modulated to milliherzts - the heart of the beacon and the project!

As Roman writes in his project description: "It doesn't require any hardware -
Pico board itself only."

With this fork, the first transmission of the beacon can be triggered by a
button. And then, after the first transmission ends, it is repeated every 4
minutes controlled by the internal RTC of the Pi Pico. The interval for the
following transmission can be configured.

Dhiru: This fork adds FT8 support.

# Hardware Setup

Just add a button between Pin 27 (`GP21`) and Pin 36 (`3V3`) on the Pico board.

The antenna connects to Pin 9 (`GP6`) on the Pico board.

# Bringing Pico beacon on air

Step 1: Configure the FT8 message (`char *message = "CQ K1TE FN42";`) to send
in the `WSPRbeacon/WSPRbeacon.c` file.

Step 2: Compile the project and copy the `build/pico-wspr-tx.uf2` file to the
Pico board.

```
mkdir -p ~/repos

cd ~/repos

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

export PICO_SDK_PATH=$HOME/repos/pico-sdk

./build.sh
```

Step 3: Power the Pico board

Step 4: Wait for the start time of the next FT8 transfer window. Press the
button to start the next broadcast.

Step 5: Use the WSJT-X software to check if the transfer is within the valid
transfer window. If necessary, repeat the start procedure.

# Amplifier?

Please note that the signal generated by the Pico is not a very clean one. A
BPF must be placed between the Pico's output and the amplifier.

https://github.com/kholia/HF-PA-v10/tree/master/IRFP-Hacks-v5-SMD is a pretty
decent amplifier design for 5W to 20W.

You can also try the `2W Amplifier 1-930MHz module` that is available on
Amazon, and other places.
